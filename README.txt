This simulation reproduces the model published 
in:

Baxter, D.A., Canavier, C.C., Clark, J.W. and Byrne, J.H.
(1999) Computational model of the serotonergic modulation of
sensory neurons in Aplysia.  J. Neurophysiol. 82: 2914-2935.

The results from one simulation (excite.smu) are illustrated 
in Baxter_excite.jpg.

To use:

Start SNNAP (double click on the SNNAP.jar file)
click on "Run Simulation"
Then in the new window "File"->"Load Simulation"
browse to and load the excite.smu file and click "Start"
